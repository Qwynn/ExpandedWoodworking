		<description>An A16 updated fork of ItchyFlea's Extended Woodworking. Each tree type now produces a unique wood specific to that tree. These new wood types can be processed into lumber which, like the base game stone bricks, can be used to construct various furnitures, buildings, and other items which are designated as 'Woody' in the stuff categories.
